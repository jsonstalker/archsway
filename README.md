## 1. Pre-installation
### 1.1 Download an installation image
An Arch Linux ISO file should be downloaded. It is recommended to download the Arch Linux ISO file from the [official Arch Linux download page](https://archlinux.org/download/) using BitTorrent, as suggested by the website.
### 1.2 Verify signature (optional but strongly recommended)
A PGP Signature file also can be downloaded for checking the integrity and authenticity of the ISO file. This file is located on the [Checksums and signatures](https://archlinux.org/download/#checksums) section of the page. Now download the [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html) software and install it. If you're on Windows you should download and install the [GPG4WIN](https://gpg4win.org/download.html) software.
